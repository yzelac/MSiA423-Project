## Project Charter 

**Vision**: Conventional methods of evaluating wine quality are primarily based on the subjective experience of tasters. This project not only explores the relationship between physiochemical properties of wines and their taste, but also intends to utlise machine learning methods to figure out which physiochemical properties make a wine taste "good."

**Mission**: Enable users to predict quality of a wine based on physiochemical properties of the wine.

**Success criteria (Machine Learning)**: The accuracy of the test dataset should be at least 80%. 

**Success criteria (Business)**: User retention rate should be at least 60%.

## Backlog 

**Develop themes**: 

Wine lovers always hope to spend their money on wines they will actually enjoy. However, without actually tasting the wine, it is often challenging for people to predict wine quality ahead of time. Even though a few famous wine critics do provide ratings on wine, those scores are still based on their subjective experience. The aim of this project is to investigate how the taste of wines are related to their measurable physiochemical properties. Through various machine learning methods, the project will help to identify the most physiochemical properties that make a wine taste good and allow users to predict the quality of wines based on their physiochemical properties. In this way, users will be able to assess wine quality from a more objective perspective and make better buying decisions.
